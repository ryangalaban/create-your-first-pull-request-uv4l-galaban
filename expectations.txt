Fermo comments: 

I agree that github could be used more frequently. I agree that there are tools that github makes available. 
I agree that you should apply the knowledge you learn in this class to your course. I especially agree wih working collaboratively because that is the point of github to work as a team or with different people on the 
same goal. I also want to enjoy the course as a whole !
